    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Mike";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = "Goober";
    console.log(players, team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[1] = "Goober";
    console.log(players, team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = "Goober";
    console.log(players, team4);

    // or
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = "BooYa";
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbros',
        fb: 'wesbros.developer'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person.age, captain.age);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    captain2.age = 44;
    console.log(person.age, captain2.age);
    // or
    const captain3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 33});
    console.log(person.age, captain3.age);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
  // cant modify social without modifying original:
    captain3.social.twitter = '@mgkroth';
    console.log(person.social);
    console.log(captain3.social);
    //poor mans way to clone an object

    const captain4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    captain4.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(person.social);
    console.log(captain4.social);
